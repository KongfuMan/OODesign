# Design a parking lot:
The parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple rows of spots.
- The parking lot can park `motorcycles`, `cars`, and `buses`.
- The parking lot has `motorcycle spots`, `compact spots`, and `large spots`.
- A motorcycle can park in any spot.
- A car can park in either a single compact spot or a single large spot.
- A bus can park in five large spots that are consecutive and within the same row. It
cannot park in small spots.

- Follow: large spot can accommodate two cars.
